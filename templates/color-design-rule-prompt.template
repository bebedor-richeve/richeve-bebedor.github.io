AI COLOR VALIDATION PROTOCOL

VALIDATION MODE — DO NOT REDESIGN

PHASE 0 — CONTEXT & AUTHORITY

    - Authority:

        - Validate a UI against a strict dark-first “Hybrid Controlled Intelligence”
          color governance system.
        - You MUST NOT redesign or suggest improvements unless violations are detected.
        - You MUST return results in the structured format only (see OUTPUT FORMAT).

    - Rule Precedence:

        - Validation rules below are authoritative for this protocol.
        - Output structure rules under OUTPUT FORMAT override general formatting.
        - If any rule is ambiguous, conflicting, or incomplete:
            - First consult any available internal flow help for guidance only.
            - Do NOT infer intent or make assumptions.
            - If ambiguity remains, stop and request clarification from the author.

    - Output Structure Binding:

        - The OUTPUT FORMAT defined in this file is the ONLY permitted structure.
        - You MUST use the format verbatim when creating validation outputs.
        - You MUST NOT invent, omit, reorder, or rename fields.

    - Flow Help Scope:

        - Any flow help defines internal decision logic only.
        - It MUST NOT override this protocol, validation rules, or the output structure.

    - Interaction Constraint:

        - Execution is non-interactive by default.
        - Do NOT ask questions unless blocked by unresolved ambiguity in the input.

    - Execution Boundary:

        - No redesign suggestions or stylistic recommendations are permitted
          unless FAIL is present in the validation results.

PHASE 1 — INGESTION

    - Ingestion Artifact: UI Viewport & Section Map

        - Input types supported:
            1. Image (single screenshot per viewport, including overlays/modals)
            2. Figma export (frames/artboards with layer geometry)
            3. Code (DOM/CSS tokens and computed styles)

        - Enumerate visible viewports and, for each viewport, list sections:
            - Viewport: a single visible screen state without scrolling
              (including modals/overlays).
            - Section: a visually bounded content group separated by spacing,
              container logic, or background differentiation.

        - Output this viewport/section map verbatim before proceeding to PHASE 2.
        - Do not analyze, group, normalize, or plan in this phase.

PHASE 2 — NORMALIZATION

    - Single-Target Cycle:

        - Select exactly one viewport for this validation cycle.
        - Within the selected viewport, include all sections visible in that state.
        - Do NOT batch multiple viewports. Process additional viewports
          in subsequent cycles.

    - Failure Rule:

        - If more than one viewport is staged or planned, stop and self-correct:
          - Unstage extra viewports from the plan.
          - Keep exactly one viewport.
          - Restart from PHASE 1 with exactly one planned viewport.

PHASE 3 — ANALYSIS

    - Measurement Guidance:

        - Surface area:
            - Image: approximate via segmentation/masking or pixel-count by
              luminance and hue classification.
            - Figma: compute area from layer frames/bounds; exclude fully transparent
              or non-visible layers.
            - Code: derive from rendered box areas and computed background colors.

        - Classification:
            - Black variants: dark neutral family designated by the system.
            - White variants: light neutral family designated by the system.
            - Accent family: one semantic color group (orange, blue, green,
              yellow, violet, red).
            - Lighter accent variant: the single lighter tone permitted across
              all accent families.

        - Evidence:
            - Report quantitative estimates (percentages, counts, sizes),
              citing viewport-level and section-level measures where applicable.

    - VALIDATION CHECKLIST (17 Rules):

        SURFACE DOMINANCE
        1. Black variants occupy ≥ 70% of visible surface area per viewport.
        2. White variants occupy ≤ 30% of visible surface area.
        3. At least 50% of the viewport contains no accent color (by visible surface area).

        ACCENT DISCIPLINE
        4. No more than two accent families are present per viewport.
        5. Only one lighter accent variant is used across all accent families.
        6. Accent colors are not used decoratively or as large background fills.
        7. Accent colors appear only when fulfilling their semantic roles.
        8. Orange appears only as primary action.
        9. Only one primary orange CTA exists per section.

        SEMANTIC INTEGRITY
        10. Color meanings are not repurposed:
            - Orange → primary action
            - Blue → system/data
            - Green → confirmation
            - Yellow → warning
            - Violet → AI/premium
            - Red → critical/destructive
        11. No more than two semantic states appear within a single section.

        HIERARCHY CONTROL
        12. Each section contains only one dominant focal element.
        13. Dominance is established through size, placement, or contrast —
            not through multiple accent colors.

        ENERGY & NOISE CONTROL
        14. The design does not feel visually energetic due to excessive saturation.
        15. Visual noise has not increased through added accent usage.
        16. If high energy is detected, confirm saturation is reduced before
            contrast adjustments.

        ACCESSIBILITY
        17. Text and critical UI elements meet WCAG AA contrast requirements.

    - Rule Output Requirements:

        - For each rule, output PASS or FAIL.
        - If FAIL, explain the violation clearly and quantitatively.

PHASE 4 — DECISION / ACTION

    - Create Validation Output:

        - Use only artifacts from PHASE 1 ingestion.
        - Follow the single-viewport-per-cycle rule.
        - Define results strictly using the OUTPUT FORMAT.
        - Do not add narrative, recommendations, or redesign notes unless FAIL exists.

    - Produce Results:

        - Return the structured output exactly as defined.
        - The count of total rules must be 17.
        - The Passed/Failed counts must match individual rule outcomes.

PHASE 5 — VERIFICATION

    - Verify Output Structure:

        - The structure fields exist and are in order.
        - Rule outcomes are complete for all 17 rules.
        - Failed rules section lists only the rules that failed, each with:
            - Description of violation
            - Estimated percentage or measurable evidence
            - Severity Level: Minor / Major / Critical

    - Verify Assessment:

        - Overall assessment is one of:
            - Controlled / Slight Drift / System Breakdown

    - Failure Handling:

        - If verification fails or structure is invalid, do not proceed.
        - Report the failure and enter a terminal stop state.
