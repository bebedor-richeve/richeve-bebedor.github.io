4.  Document Status:

    - This document is a DRAFT specification guide.
    - It explains the color validation protocol flow and decision logic.
    - It supplements the main color-design-rule-prompt.template file.
    - It provides procedural guidance for AI agents executing validation.

5.  Protocol Overview:

    The protocol consists of 6 phases, each with a specific purpose and
    decision point:

    - Phase 0: Establish authority and read all governing documents
    - Phase 1: Ingest UI design and enumerate viewports and sections
    - Phase 2: Normalize to single-viewport-per-cycle
    - Phase 3: Analyze color usage against 22 validation rules
    - Phase 4: Produce structured validation output
    - Phase 5: Verify output structure and completeness

    The protocol is designed to prevent redesign suggestions unless violations
    are detected and ensure every validation follows the structured output
    format.

6.  Phase Execution Guide:

    6.1 Phase 0 — Authority & Preconditions

        Purpose: Establish that the AI agent has read and understands all
        governing documents before proceeding.

        Why this phase exists:
        - Prevents misinterpretation of rules
        - Ensures consistency across all validations
        - Establishes a clear authority hierarchy

        AI agent decision logic:
        - Read 5LAWS first (overrides all other rules)
        - Read RULES second (repository-level constraints)
        - Read FORMAT third (document structure standards)
        - Read templates/color-design-rule-prompt.template
        - Use this document to resolve procedural or flow ambiguity
        - If any rule is ambiguous, conflicting, or incomplete:
            - Attempt resolution using this flow guide
            - Do NOT infer intent or create new rules
            - If ambiguity remains unresolved, STOP
            - Request clarification from the developer
        - Proceed only when no unresolved ambiguity exists

        Success criteria:
        - All governing documents have been read
        - No unresolved ambiguities or conflicts remain
        - Agent is ready to proceed to Phase 1

    6.2 Phase 1 — Ingestion

        Purpose: Enumerate all visible viewports and sections so the agent
        knows exactly what UI elements need to be validated.

        Why this phase exists:
        - Prevents accidental omission of UI elements
        - Provides a clear baseline for validation
        - Allows developer to review what will be validated

        AI agent decision logic:
        - Accept input as image, Figma export, or code
        - Identify all visible viewports (including modals/overlays)
        - For each viewport, enumerate sections:
            - Viewport: single visible screen state without scrolling
            - Section: visually bounded content group separated by spacing,
              container logic, or background differentiation
        - Output this viewport/section map verbatim before proceeding
        - Do NOT analyze, group, normalize, or plan in this phase
        - If UI design is unclear or ambiguous:
            - STOP and request clarification from the developer

        Success criteria:
        - All viewports and sections are enumerated
        - UI design is unambiguous
        - Agent may proceed to Phase 2

    6.3 Phase 2 — Normalization

        Purpose: Select exactly one viewport for validation to ensure atomic,
        focused analysis.

        Why this phase exists:
        - Ensures one viewport per validation cycle
        - Prevents batching of multiple viewports
        - Allows focused analysis per viewport
        - Catches violations early

        AI agent decision logic:
        - Select exactly one viewport from Phase 1 for the current cycle
        - Include all sections visible in that viewport
        - Batched viewport validation is never allowed
        - Output the selected viewport before proceeding
        - If more than one viewport is staged or planned:
            - STOP and self-correct
            - Unstage extra viewports from the plan
            - Keep exactly one viewport
            - Restart from Phase 1 with exactly one planned viewport

        Self-correction (mandatory):
        - If more than one viewport is staged or planned, STOP and self-correct
        - Unstage extra viewports
        - Keep exactly one viewport
        - Restart from Phase 1 with exactly one planned viewport
        - Do NOT ask the developer to choose a viewport

        Success criteria:
        - One viewport selected for validation
        - All sections in that viewport are included
        - Agent may proceed to Phase 3

    6.4 Phase 3 — Analysis

        Purpose: Evaluate color usage against 22 validation rules.

        Why this phase exists:
        - Ensures compliance with color governance system
        - Provides quantitative evidence for violations
        - Prevents subjective or inconsistent validation

        AI agent decision logic:
        - Measure surface area by input type:
            - Image: approximate via segmentation/masking or pixel-count
            - Figma: compute area from layer frames/bounds
            - Code: derive from rendered box areas and computed colors
        - Classify colors:
            - Black variants: dark neutral family
            - White variants: light neutral family
            - Accent family: one semantic color group
            - Lighter accent variant: single lighter tone
        - Evaluate against 22 rules:

            Surface Dominance (Rules 1-3) — Goals: Focus, Simplicity
            1. Black variants occupy ≥ 70% of visible surface area per viewport
            2. White variants occupy ≤ 30% of visible surface area
            3. At least 50% of viewport contains no accent color

            Accent Discipline (Rules 4-9) — Goals: Attention, Influence
            4. No more than two accent families are present per viewport
            5. Only one lighter accent variant is used across all families
            6. Accent colors are not used decoratively or as large fills
            7. Accent colors appear only when fulfilling semantic roles
            8. Orange appears only as primary action
            9. Only one primary orange CTA exists per section

            Semantic Integrity (Rules 10-11) — Goals: Clarity, Influence
            10. Color meanings are not repurposed (Orange → primary action,
                Blue → system/data, Green → confirmation, Yellow → warning,
                Violet → AI/premium, Red → critical/destructive)
            11. No more than two semantic states appear within a single section

            Hierarchy Control (Rules 12-13) — Goals: Dominance, Focus
            12. Each section contains only one dominant focal element
            13. Dominance is established through size, placement, or contrast

            Energy & Noise Control (Rules 14-16) — Goals: Focus, Attention
            14. Productive attention-getting (CTAs, alerts) uses controlled
                saturation bursts on dark backgrounds
            15. Distracting noise (decorative accents, excessive gradients)
                is absent or minimal
            16. If high energy is detected, verify it serves a clear behavioral
                goal (click, read, avoid) before flagging as violation

            Curiosity Framework (Rules 17-18) — Goals: Curiosity, Attention
            17. Subtle accent variations (tints, shades within one family) may
                appear to create visual interest without breaking semantic rules
            18. Accent usage creates visual "breadcrumbs" that guide exploration
                (e.g., progressive disclosure, hover reveals)

            Interactive States (Rules 19-21) — Goals: Influence, Clarity
            19. Hover states increase brightness/saturation within the same
                accent family (no family shifts)
            20. Focus states add visible outlines or glows that meet WCAG
                contrast requirements
            21. Active/pressed states darken or desaturate to signal response

            Accessibility (Rule 22) — Goals: Clarity, Focus
            22. Text and critical UI elements meet WCAG AA contrast requirements
                (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text/UI components)

        - For each rule, output PASS or FAIL
        - If FAIL, explain violation clearly and quantitatively
        - If PASS on curiosity/interactive rules (17-21), note examples
          of effective implementation when present
        - Report quantitative estimates (percentages, counts, sizes)

        Success criteria:
        - All 22 rules evaluated
        - Violations explained with quantitative evidence
        - Agent may proceed to Phase 4

    6.5 Phase 4 — Decision / Action

        Purpose: Produce structured validation output.

        Why this phase exists:
        - Ensures consistent output format
        - Prevents narrative or subjective commentary
        - Provides actionable results

        AI agent decision logic:
        - Use only artifacts from Phase 1 ingestion
        - Follow the single-viewport-per-cycle rule
        - Define results strictly using the OUTPUT FORMAT
        - Do not add narrative, recommendations, or redesign notes unless
          FAIL exists
        - For rules 17-21 (curiosity/interactive), provide brief positive
          examples when patterns are well-executed
        - Output the validation plan before execution
        - Return the structured output exactly as defined
        - The count of total rules must be 22
        - The Passed/Failed counts must match individual rule outcomes
        - Calculate 30% budget allocation (white + accent usage)
        - Provide strategic guidance on optimizing remaining budget
        - If any rule violates format:
            - STOP and report the issue

        Success criteria:
        - Output matches the required format
        - All 22 rules are included
        - Counts are accurate
        - Strategic budget guidance is provided

    6.6 Phase 5 — Verification

        Purpose: Validate output structure and completeness.

        Why this phase exists:
        - Prevents invalid output from being returned
        - Enforces strict compliance

        AI agent decision logic:
        - Verify the structure fields exist and are in order
        - Verify rule outcomes are complete for all 22 rules
        - Verify failed rules section lists only the rules that failed
        - Verify each failed rule has:
            - Description of violation
            - Estimated percentage or measurable evidence
            - Severity Level: Minor / Major / Critical
        - Verify positive patterns section (optional) only includes rules 17-21
        - Verify strategic guidance section includes budget breakdown
        - Verify overall assessment is one of:
            - Controlled / Slight Drift / System Breakdown
        - If validation is incomplete:
            - Restart from Phase 1 and repeat all phases
            - Continue cycling until validation is complete
            - Do NOT terminate early while validation is incomplete
        - If verification fails or structure is invalid:
            - Do NOT proceed
            - Report the failure and enter a terminal stop state

        Success criteria:
        - Output structure is valid
        - All 22 rules are validated
        - Protocol TERMINATES SUCCESSFULLY

7.  AI Agent Decision Tree:

    START
      ↓
    Phase 0: Read documents
      ├─ Ambiguity resolved internally? → Continue
      ├─ Ambiguity unresolved? → STOP, request clarification
      ↓
    Phase 1: Ingest UI design
      ├─ Design unclear? → STOP
      └─ Design clear? → Continue
      ↓
    Phase 2: Normalize to single viewport
      ├─ Multiple viewports staged? → Self-correct, restart Phase 1
      └─ Single viewport? → Continue
      ↓
    Phase 3: Analyze color usage
      ├─ Violation? → Document with quantitative evidence
      └─ Pass? → Document pass
      ↓
    Phase 4: Produce output
      ├─ Format violation? → STOP
      └─ Format valid? → Continue
      ↓
    Phase 5: Verify output
      ├─ Incomplete? → Restart Phase 1
      ├─ Invalid? → STOP
      └─ Valid? → TERMINATE SUCCESSFULLY

    Note: Rules 17-21 (curiosity/interactive) may include positive examples
    when well-executed, even if overall result is PASS.

8.  Common Scenarios:

    8.1 Scenario: Developer provides template without UI design

        - Phase 0: Read documents
        - Phase 1: No UI design provided
        - Decision: STOP, request UI design input

    8.2 Scenario: Multiple viewports in UI design

        - Phase 0: Read documents
        - Phase 1: Enumerate all viewports
        - Phase 2: STOP and self-correct (no author question)
        - Action: Select exactly one viewport
        - Phase 3-5: Analyze, produce output, verify that single viewport
        - Repeat Phase 1-5 for each remaining viewport

    8.3 Scenario: Violation detected in Phase 3

        - Phase 3: Black variants occupy only 50% of surface area
        - Decision: Mark Rule 1 as FAIL
        - Action: Document violation with quantitative evidence
        - Continue to Phase 4 with FAIL result

    8.4 Scenario: Interactive states need validation

        - Phase 3: Hover state changes orange CTA to blue
        - Decision: Mark Rule 19 as FAIL (family shift violation)
        - Action: Document that hover should brighten orange, not change family
        - Continue to Phase 4 with FAIL result

    8.5 Scenario: Curiosity pattern well-executed

        - Phase 3: Subtle violet tints guide user through AI feature discovery
        - Decision: Mark Rule 17 as PASS
        - Action: Note positive example in output (optional section)
        - Continue to Phase 4 with PASS result

    8.6 Scenario: Verification fails in Phase 5

        - Phase 5: Output missing severity level for failed rule
        - Decision: Do NOT return output
        - Action: Report failure, request developer review

9.  Validation Checklist:

    Before executing the protocol, verify:

    - [ ] Developer has provided templates/color-design-rule-prompt.template
    - [ ] UI design input is provided (image, Figma, or code)
    - [ ] All viewports and sections are identified
    - [ ] Each viewport will be validated separately (atomic)
    - [ ] Surface area measurement method is appropriate for input type
    - [ ] Color classification is clear (black, white, accent variants)
    - [ ] All 22 rules will be evaluated
    - [ ] Violations will be documented with quantitative evidence
    - [ ] Output format will be followed exactly
    - [ ] No redesign suggestions unless FAIL is present
    - [ ] Protocol phases will be followed in order
    - [ ] Viewport/section map will be output before analysis
    - [ ] Validation output will be verified before return
    - [ ] Incomplete validation will trigger restart from Phase 1
    - [ ] Interactive states (hover, focus, active) will be evaluated
    - [ ] Curiosity patterns will be assessed for effectiveness
    - [ ] 30% budget allocation will be calculated and reported

10. Strategic Budget Guidance:

    The 30% non-black surface budget (white + accent) should be allocated
    strategically to maximize impact on user goals.

    10.1 Budget Calculation

        - Total viewport surface area = 100%
        - Black variants (minimum) = 70%
        - Available budget = 30%
        - Budget components:
            - White surfaces (text, cards, highlights)
            - Accent surfaces (CTAs, alerts, semantic indicators)

    10.2 Optimal Allocation Patterns

        High-conversion viewports (landing, checkout):
        - White: 20-25% (readability, trust)
        - Accent: 5-10% (focused CTAs, urgency indicators)
        - Goal: Drive specific action with minimal distraction

        Information-dense viewports (dashboards, data tables):
        - White: 15-20% (data clarity, grid structure)
        - Accent: 10-15% (status indicators, alerts)
        - Goal: Enable quick scanning and pattern recognition

        Exploratory viewports (feature discovery, onboarding):
        - White: 10-15% (progressive disclosure cards)
        - Accent: 15-20% (curiosity breadcrumbs, interactive hints)
        - Goal: Encourage exploration without overwhelming

    10.3 Budget Optimization Recommendations

        When budget is underutilized (< 20% total):
        - Consider adding white space for breathing room
        - Evaluate if key CTAs have sufficient contrast
        - Check if semantic states are clearly communicated

        When budget is overutilized (> 30% total):
        - Identify decorative accent usage to remove
        - Consolidate white surfaces (merge cards, reduce borders)
        - Verify accent colors serve semantic purposes

        When budget is well-balanced (20-30% total):
        - Document effective patterns for reuse
        - Verify allocation matches viewport goals
        - Ensure remaining budget serves strategic reserve

11. Curiosity Framework Examples:

    Curiosity is achieved through subtle variations and progressive disclosure,
    not through adding more accent families or increasing saturation.

    11.1 Effective Curiosity Patterns

        Tonal progression within one family:
        - Violet-900 (dark) → Violet-700 (medium) → Violet-500 (bright)
        - Use case: AI feature tiers (basic → advanced → premium)
        - Why it works: Creates visual hierarchy without semantic confusion

        Hover reveals with same-family brightening:
        - Default: Orange-600 CTA on black background
        - Hover: Orange-500 (brighter, same family)
        - Reveal: Additional context text in white
        - Why it works: Rewards exploration, maintains semantic clarity

        Progressive disclosure breadcrumbs:
        - Step 1: Blue-700 indicator (current)
        - Step 2: Blue-500 indicator (next, slightly brighter)
        - Step 3: Blue-300 indicator (future, subtle hint)
        - Why it works: Guides attention forward, creates anticipation

        Subtle accent variations for categorization:
        - Category A: Green-600 (confirmation actions)
        - Category B: Green-500 (success states)
        - Why it works: Maintains semantic meaning while allowing distinction

    11.2 Ineffective Curiosity Patterns (Violations)

        Multiple accent families for decoration:
        - Orange CTA + Blue decoration + Violet border
        - Why it fails: Creates semantic confusion, violates Rule 4

        High saturation for visual interest:
        - Neon accents on dark background for "energy"
        - Why it fails: Distracting noise, violates Rule 15

        Family shifts on interaction:
        - Default: Orange CTA
        - Hover: Blue CTA (family change)
        - Why it fails: Breaks semantic meaning, violates Rule 19

        Accent backgrounds for content areas:
        - Large violet background for "premium feel"
        - Why it fails: Decorative usage, violates Rule 6

    11.3 Curiosity Evaluation Criteria

        When evaluating Rules 17-18, ask:
        - Does the variation stay within one accent family?
        - Does it guide user behavior toward a goal?
        - Does it reward exploration without demanding attention?
        - Does it maintain semantic integrity?
        - Does it create anticipation or discovery moments?

        If yes to all: PASS with positive example notation
        If no to any: FAIL with specific violation explanation
