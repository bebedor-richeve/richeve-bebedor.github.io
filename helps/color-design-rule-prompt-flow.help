VALIDATION MODE — DO NOT REDESIGN

You are validating a UI against a strict dark-first “Hybrid Controlled Intelligence” color governance system.

You must NOT redesign or suggest improvements unless violations are detected.

Return results in structured format only.

INPUT

The UI design (image, Figma export, or code) is provided.

DEFINITIONS

Viewport: A single visible screen state without scrolling (including modals/overlays).

Section: A visually bounded content group separated by spacing, container logic, or background differentiation.

Accent Family: One semantic color group (orange, blue, green, yellow, violet, red).

VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Evaluate the design against the following constraints.

For each rule:

Output: PASS or FAIL

If FAIL: Explain violation clearly and quantitatively.

SURFACE DOMINANCE

Black variants occupy ≥ 70% of visible surface area per viewport.

White variants occupy ≤ 30% of visible surface area.

At least 50% of the viewport contains no accent color (by visible surface area).

ACCENT DISCIPLINE

No more than two accent families are present per viewport.

Only one lighter accent variant is used across all accent families.

Accent colors are not used decoratively or as large background fills.

Accent colors appear only when fulfilling their semantic roles.

Orange appears only as primary action.

Only one primary orange CTA exists per section.

SEMANTIC INTEGRITY

Color meanings are not repurposed:

Orange → primary action

Blue → system/data

Green → confirmation

Yellow → warning

Violet → AI/premium

Red → critical/destructive

No more than two semantic states appear within a single section.

HIERARCHY CONTROL

Each section contains only one dominant focal element.

Dominance is established through size, placement, or contrast — not through multiple accent colors.

ENERGY & NOISE CONTROL

The design does not feel visually energetic due to excessive saturation.

Visual noise has not increased through added accent usage.

If high energy is detected, confirm saturation is reduced before contrast adjustments.

ACCESSIBILITY

Text and critical UI elements meet WCAG AA contrast requirements.

OUTPUT FORMAT

Return the following structure:

VALIDATION RESULT: PASS / FAIL

SUMMARY:
- Total Rules Checked: 17
- Passed: X
- Failed: X

FAILED RULES:
Rule #:

Do not provide redesign suggestions unless FAIL is present.
